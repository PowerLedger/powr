title: Command-line Guide
---

In this section, we will describe how to use command-line tools to
create a _wallet_, to send and receive POWR tokens, and to participate in
the Powerledger blockchain network by delegating stake.

To interact with one of the Powerledger blockchain clusters, we will use the command-line interface, also
known as the CLI. We use the command-line because it is the first place that new functionality is deployed. 
The command-line interface is not necessarily the easiest to use, but it provides the most direct, flexible, and
secure access to your Powerledger blockchain accounts.

## Getting Started

The Powerledger blockchain network is an SVM network based on the Solana codebase, due to this, Powerledger 
makes use of the Solana CLI toolset to interact with the blockchain cluster via command line.

To get started using the Solana Command Line (CLI) tools:

- [Install the CLI Tools](cli/install-solana-cli-tools.md)
- [Choose a Cluster](cli/choose-a-cluster.md)
- [Create a Wallet](wallet-guide/cli.md)
- [Check out our CLI conventions](cli/conventions.md)
