title: Running a Validator
---

This section describes how to run a validator node on the Powerledger blockchain.

There are several clusters available to connect to; see [choosing a Cluster](cli/choose-a-cluster.md) for an overview of each.

There is a very specific set of instructions that need to be followed in order to install the validator software and set up a validator on the blockchain to begin receiving stake delegations and processing blocks to receive rewards.

## Setting up your environment

In order to set up a validator, first you need to install the prerequisite software and tooling and change some configuration of the system the validator will be running on. Powerledger strongly recommends using Ubuntu 20.04 as the operating system, and cannot provide technical support for any other operating system. 

From a fresh ubuntu 20.04 installation, the installation instructions can be found on [github](https://github.com/Powerledger/powr)

## Creating a vote account

Instructions for creating a vote account are included in the github instructions. You will require some initial POWR on the Powerledger blockchain to fund the validators id and vote account. Contact Powerledger to conduct this transfer until a blockchain bridge is deployed.
